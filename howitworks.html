                <p>All types of bacteria have a range of temperature where they can function properly. And they have an optimal temperature where they are adapted to work the fastest.</p>
                <p>If the temperature is lower than the optimal temperature, the enzymes within the bacteria won't work efficiently, thus growth rate will be lower.</p>
                <p>If the temperature is higher than the optimal temperature, the active sites of the enzymes within the bacteria will denature, thus growth rate will be lower.</p>

                <h2><a href="Mesophiles.html">Mesophiles</a></h2>
                <p>Mesophoile bacteria are microorganisms which thrive in moderate temperatures, usually between 20°C and 45°C. 
                    They are the most common type of bacteria found in the human body and are responsible for many important processes, including digestion and fermentation.</p>
                <p>Mesophiles are also used in various industrial applications, such as the production of yogurt, cheese, and other fermented foods. 
                    These bacteria are typically aerobic, meaning they require oxygen to grow, but some can also survive in anaerobic conditions.</p>
                <p>Mesophiles play a crucial role in maintaining the balance of ecosystems and are essential for the health of humans and animals alike.</p>
                <p>They have an optimal temperature around 37°C.</p>
                <h2><a href="Thermophiles.html">Thermophiles</a></h2>
                <p>Thermophile bacteria are microorganisms which thrive in high temperatures, usually between 45°C and 80°C. 
                    They are commonly found in extreme environments such as hot springs, geothermal vents, and compost heaps, where most other life forms would tap out.</p>
                <p>Thermophiles are used in various industrial applications, including the production of enzymes for biofuels, PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) in genetic testing,
                     and waste treatment. These bacteria are typically aerobic, requiring oxygen to grow, though some species can also survive in anaerobic conditions.</p>
                <p>Thermophiles play a crucial role in breaking down organic matter in high-temperature environments and contribute significantly to nutrient cycling in these ecosystems.</p>
                <p>They have an optimal temperature around 60°C or higher.</p>
                <h2><a href="Psychrophiles.html">Psychrophiles</a></h2>
                <p>Psychrophile bacteria are microorganisms which thrive in cold temperatures, typically between -20°C and 10°C. 
                    They are commonly found in polar regions, deep ocean waters, glaciers, and permafrost — basically, anywhere that would make most life freeze solid.</p>
                <p>Psychrophiles are valuable in scientific research and industry, especially in biotechnology fields that require enzymes that function at low temperatures, 
                    such as in food preservation and cold-wash laundry detergents. These bacteria can be aerobic or anaerobic, depending on their environment.</p>
                <p>Psychrophiles play a vital role in breaking down organic matter in cold ecosystems and contribute to nutrient cycling in environments where most other 
                    microbes can't survive.</p>
                <p>They have an optimal temperature around 4°C or lower.</p>

                <h1>ANTIBIOTICS</h1>
                <h2><a href="antibiotics.html">Antibiotic Simulator</a></h2>
                <p>Antibiotics are substances that can kill or inhibit the growth of bacteria. They are used to treat bacterial 
                    infections and are often prescribed by doctors. However, not all antibiotics work against all types of bacteria. 
                    Some antibiotical substances are stronger than others to certain bacterias.</p>
                <p>In a lab, to measure the effectiveness of certain antibacerial substances, scientists often use multidiscs. Where each arm will have a different antibacterial substance. 
                    The strongest antibacterial will kill more bacteria. This leaves a black space on the petri dish, called the inhibition zone. 
                    This zone will be clear in colour as no bacteria grows. 
                    The bigger the inhibition zone, the more effective the antibiotic is in killing that certain bacteria.</p>
